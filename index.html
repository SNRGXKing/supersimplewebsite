    <h1>How to create a website like a professional.</h1>
   <p>Today you will learn how to make a website. 
    But I will only tell you the steps and places to go when you wanna learn and create a website. 
    So let's learn.</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Which language to choose.</li>
        <li>Where to go and learn.</li>
        
        <li>How to publish the website on the internet.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The first step:</h2>

        <p>The first step is to go ahead and pick a language to code. 
            Now some people may think I am talking about languages like English and Chinese. 
            But I am not.
            I am talking about languages like HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, C++.
            The languauge I would recommend to a beginner is HTML and CSS.
            They are easy to lewarn and great for beginners.
            But you can also choose Python.</p>
    
    <h2>The second step:</h2>
    
    <p>The second step is where to and learn the language you want to learn.
        Let's say you want to learen for free. I recommend this <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank">website.</a>
        But you may also have some spare money around then I recommend the same website. This website
        is very easy to use and you can learn any language with no hiccups. I also used it to learn HTML 
        and CSS.
    </p>
     <h2>The third step:</h2>
    <p>The third step is very easy. if you have finished your course then this step will be very easy for you.
        To publish your website for free you can watch the video at the bottom of the page. But for a domain name like 
        website.com you do have to pay a few dollars per year.
